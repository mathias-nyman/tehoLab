            Performance Comparison of Five Programming Languages: 
                       C, C++, Java, Perl and Python

=============================================================================


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files and Directories
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The directory structure for the source code is as described below, with each
language specific directory containing all the different implementations in
separate files for the three tests; Concatenation, Matrix multiplication and
Regular expression.

Makefile
data/
src/
    c/
        Makefile
        ConcatX.c
        MatrixMultX.c
        RegexpX.c
    cpp/
    java/
    perl/
    python/

Each language specific folder also contains it's own Makefile, which can be
used for compiling and running single implementations or all tests in the
directory. The top-level Makefile includes each sub-makefile and adds targets
for running a test set (e.g. Regexp) for all implementations in all
languages, or only all implementations of a test set for one language, or
simply compile and run all test sets.

The data-directory in the repository contains reasonably sized data sets, but
large-sized data shall be fetched prior running the tests (see Dependencies).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependencies
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A basic development environment is considered as a pre-requisit, including at
least the following: Make, gcc, g++, JDK, Perl and Python. In addition to
this, Boost Regex library is needed, which can be installed by issuing the
following command in the top-level directory:

  make boost

Some large-sized data is needed as input, and can be fetched by issuing the
following command in the top-level directory:

  make data


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile and run all the tests in the repository simply run the following
command in the top-level directory:

  make
